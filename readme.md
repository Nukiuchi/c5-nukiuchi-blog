<h1>Blog for Concrete5 version 5.7</h1>

Structured as a package.

Trying to make use of the new 5.7 features as much as I can,
to make this work as an example for future projects.

Extra focus given for Doctrine ORM and modern, responsive theming.

Is, and probably always will be, Work In Progress.

<h2>Some intended functions</h2>

<h3>Blog features</h3>
- Single Blog for the environment (Simple Single Page), 
   blog accessible at /blog
- Multiple blogs (Single Page with possibility to choose displayed blog),
   e.g. /blog/nukiuchi
- Look into implementing popular features, like tagging, tag cloud

<h3>Theme</h3>
- Use Bootstrap 3
- Use built-in LESS
- Make it look nice (yeah right..)
