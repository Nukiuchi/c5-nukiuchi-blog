Blog for Concrete5 5.7.

Structured as a package.

Trying to make use of the new 5.7 features as much as I can,
to make this work as an example for future projects.

Extra focus given for Doctrine ORM and modern theming.

Is, and probably always will be, Work In Progress.

Some intended functions:
Blog features:
- Single Blog for the environment (Simple Single Page), 
   blog accessible at /blog
- Multiple blogs (Single Page with possibility to choose displayed blog),
   e.g. /blog/nukiuchi
- Look into implementing popular features, like tagging, tag cloud

Theme:
- Use Bootstrap 3
- Use built-in LESS
- Make it look nice (yeah right..)
